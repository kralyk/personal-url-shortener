This is a very simple URL shortener with QR codes support
for mostly personal use written in PHP.

To use, edit config.php and .htaccess accordingly and upload to your site.
You don't need to have the application and the links on the same (sub)domain,
which means you can, for example, access the interface at url.example.com
and the links at ex.com/xxxxx.

There is no admin interface.


REQUIREMENTS:
Recent version of PHP and MySQL.
