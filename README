This is a very simple URL shortener for mostly personal use.
Written in PHP.

To use, edit config.php and .htaccess accordingly and upload to your site.
The .htaccess and the rest of the application do not have to be on the same (sub)domain,
which means you can, for example, access the interface at url.example.com for
and the links at ex.com/xxxxx

There is no admin interface.


REQUIREMENTS:
Recent version of PHP and MySQL.
